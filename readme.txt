Tasks / Features:
-   DOM MANIPULATION:
    The script "welcomeScript" will be triggered on load and will trigger an alert that welcomes the visitor.
    The script also changes the first h2-heading after the user closes the alert on the index page.
    Using jQuery we retrieve the heading and change the html. For further DOM manipulation, see our Knowledge
    Base page.
-   EVENT LISTENERS:
    On the index page we use event listeners like "onclick" to process events. Also our welcome script will be called on window load.
-   EVENT PROPAGATION: 
    On the index page we have a button which says "Click me!". This button is inside a section. These elements
    both trigger an alert when clicked on. If you click the button it will bubble up and trigger the button message
    first and then the section message. The alerts should display "You" > "Clicked".
-   JQUERY:
    All javascript files make use of jQuery and its syntax using the $-sign.
-   JQUERY UI + APPEARANCE CHANGE: 
    on the index page we make use of a checkbox from the jQuery UI library. With this checkbox you can toggle
    the video on and off.
